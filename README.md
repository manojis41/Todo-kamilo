![Todo-kamilo](https://github.com/manojis41/Todo-kamilo/assets/126950007/11332947-0733-4955-920c-155549ef2980)


Welcome to Todo-Kamilo, a simple todo list app built with Python's Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using SQLite as the database. This app, also known as the Ajingar variant internally, is a basic implementation without form validation in both the frontend and backend.

## Features
- Add tasks to your todo list
- Mark tasks as completed
- Edit tasks if you make mistakes
- Delete tasks from the list
- View completed tasks too

## Future Plans
In the future, Todo-Kamilo will be enhanced to include:
- User authentication for individual sessions (login)
- Improved form validation for a better user experience
- Ability to create and manage multiple todo lists

## Usage
For now, the app is hosted and open to everyone. You can add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them without the need for login. Keep in mind that all tasks are visible to everyone, as there are no individual sessions.

Feel free to contribute to the project by submitting bug reports, feature requests, or code improvements. Your feedback is valuable in shaping the future of Todo-Kamilo.

Let's make todo list management simple and enjoyable!
